Don't make offering names or Amazon or AWS trademarks possessive by adding an apostrophe, for example "AWS' next launch" or "Amazon EMR's newest feature."
Don't hyphenate AWS, S3, or any AWS trademark.
Use offering names as proper nouns or as adjectives, for example, "Amazon EC2 instance." Do not use offering names, or Amazon or AWS trademarks, as common nouns or verbs, for example, "your lambda" or "autoscaling your cluster."
Do spell out the correct AWS legal entity in full on first reference (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Inc.). Using "AWS" for subsequent references is acceptable.
Do refer to AWS services as the "AWS cloud" or just "AWS." The latter is preferred.
Do refer to AWS as a "cloud provider” or a "cloud services provider.”
Do talk about how customers can build their applications and power their businesses using AWS.
Don’t use "cloud platform" or a "platform” to refer to AWS, the AWS Marketplace, or the AWS Partner Network. For example, don’t say: "For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.”
Don’t use "ecosystem” to refer to AWS, its services, its customers, the AWS Partner Network, or AWS Marketplace.
Don't use "gateway” to refer to AWS or its services.

Don't make statements that are false or misleading.
Don't appropriate claims made about AWS by a third party.
Don’t describe AWS or its services as having network effects.
Do describe AWS services instead of using "SaaS," "IaaS," or "PaaS" to refer to AWS. For example: "Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a broad set of services you can use as building blocks to run sophisticated and scalable applications."
Do use "SaaS," "IaaS," or "PaaS" if absolutely required, such as in direct quotes or to accurately paraphrase separate content from a third party. For example: "Gartner recommends AWS as a PaaS provider."

Do accurately describe the performance of AWS services (e.g., durability) by using phrases like "designed for" or "designed to provide."
Don't promise outcomes by using terms such as "ensure," "guarantee," "100% uptime," or "unlimited" ("virtually unlimited" is acceptable, if accurate).
Do focus the message on customers, not competitors. For example: Discuss the benefits AWS can offer to help solve customer problems.
Don't use the term "market." Phrases like "going to market" or "go-to-market strategies" are acceptable as long as no statements are made about the parameters of the "market."
Don't use the term "market segment share."
Don’t use the term "market segment" except in very limited circumstances where the term is properly defined to include a broad range of competitive offerings and captures all possible substitutable products. Narrow groupings of products, geographies, or channels can miss important competitive alternatives. A single product type, manufacturer, or supplier is not a market segment.
Don't use the term "market share."

Don’t use the term “product category share.”
Don’t refer to geos, areas, or regions as markets; instead specify that geo name or region.
Don’t refer to product and service categories as markets; instead, refer to them as “products” or “services,” or specify their features and capabilities.

Don't make hyper-competitive statements. For example, don’t use phrases like: "AWS is dominant," "AWS is destroying its competitors," "AWS is capturing customers," or “AWS is a hyperscaler.”
Don't suggest the market is narrow if the market is broad. For example: AWS competes with on-premises server solutions not just serverless solution providers.
Don't suggest there are few competitors if there are many competitors. For example, don’t say: AWS competes for customers with on-premises solution providers and not only other cloud services providers.
Don't suggest that AWS is "the only way to reach a customer," "the only one," or "essential" to a customer's business.
Do be clear that AWS is a leader in enabling multicloud solutions.

Don't refer to AWS as a "utility," "critical infrastructure," or" essential infrastructure."
Don’t compare AWS to a utility provider.
Do explain that security of customer content and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and each customer.
Do explain that cloud security is the highest priority at AWS. AWS data centers are highly secure, and AWS has implemented strong safeguards to help protect customer content. AWS helps secure the underlying infrastructure, and customers are responsible for securing any content they put on that infrastructure. AWS assists customers with their part of shared responsibility by making available various security-related tools, such as encryption functionality, to protect their content.
Do explain that AWS is certified under numerous certification programs and that AWS helps customers achieve their compliance goals by giving customers simple, powerful tools to determine where their content will be stored, secure the content in transit or at rest, and manage access to AWS services and resources.
Don't suggest that AWS will unilaterally make customer content secure, meet compliance standards, or ensure legal compliance (e.g., HIPAA or GDPR). Outcomes like "security" and "compliance" depend heavily on the customer's actions and choices. For example, rephrase as follows: "Ensuring the security of our customers' data is our top priority at AWS."
Don't suggest that AWS is not secure. For example, rephrase as follows: "With its powerful anti-malware engine and advanced protection technologies, New Customer Product X secures the provides an additional layer of security for the already secure Amazon WorkSpaces environment."
Do refer to AWS as a "cloud provider” or a "cloud services provider.”
Do talk about how customers can build their applications and power their businesses using AWS.

Don't use "gateway” to refer to AWS or its services.
Don't refer to AWS as a public cloud because that implies there is some other kind of cloud.

Don't make statements that are false or misleading.
Don't appropriate claims made about AWS by a third party.
Don’t describe AWS or its services as having network effects.
First-person for authors ("I" or "we" for multiple authors), second-person to address readers ("you"
Do not use "we" to speak for AWS unless you are doing so officially and have been cleared by the Social Media team.
Begin the introduction with a common use case or problem, ask a question, or highlight an industry trend.
Whenever possible, use the active voice instead of the passive voice. The passive form is typically wordier and can often cause writers to obscure the details of the action.
Refer to the reader as you (second person) and refer to AWS as we (first person).
For procedures or instructions, ensure that action is taken by the reader rather than the author.
Reserve the first person plural for speaking as AWS, with recommendations, warnings, or explanations.
use the present tense. Use the future tense only when an event happens later than, not immediately after, the action under discussion.
The overall tone is informal, informative, and friendly without getting chatty.
Avoid excessive words, such as "please." Be courteous but not wordy. Extra detail can often be moved elsewhere.
Use contractions carefully for a more casual tone. Use common contractions. Avoid future tense
Don't use archaic ('twas), colloquial (ain't), or compound (couldn't've) contractions.
write content that is structured in a way to allow the best results from search engine crawling and result page position.
limit your sentences to fewer than 25 words.
it's a good idea to avoid "ing's" in regular text if you can. If you can't find an alternative, sometimes you can add a determiner to clarify whether an "-ing" word is an adjective or a verb.
Like "-ing" words, "-ed" words can be ambiguous. Often you can add a determiner to clarify the function of such a word.
Avoid slang, jargon, and colloquialisms
Avoid Latin phrases
Don't try to find new, more interesting, or idiomatic ways of saying the same thing. Choose one term, define it, and then use that same term every time.
Use precise words that have only one meaning
Avoid Weasel Words
